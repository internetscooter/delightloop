About
-----
This is a digital whiteboard tailored to [Delight Loop](https://www.delightloop.com) Prosocial workshops and is derived from [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net). This is a specialised version aimed at realtime team collaboration and [Prosocial](https://www.prosocial.world) implementation.


Development
-----------

This is in active developent on [github](https://github.com/internetscooter/delightloop) and closely follows diagrams.net [drawio](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio), hence the use of "delightloop" default branch. The development heavily focuses on reuse and feeding back new features to diagrams.net. The aim of this project is providing a subset of features that are presented as intuitively as possible to users (with diagrams being compatible with diagrams.nt)
