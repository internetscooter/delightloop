About
-----
This is a tool to support Delight Loop workshops and is derived from [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net). This is a specialised version aimed at realtime team collaboration and Prosocial implementation.

This is in developent and closely follows diagrams.net [drawio](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio), hence the use of delightloop master branch.

Here is the Github pages [Delight Loop Implementation](https://internetscooter.github.io/delightloop/src/main/webapp/index.html)
